  Why do most student ML projects gather digital dust? Here's how to ship one that actually survives outside your repo.

I used to treat class ML projects like short stories: build, submit, move on. But when I sat on an interview panel, I started to see a pattern—most student "projects" just... broke! Either no README, horrendous setup, or the expected results weren’t reproducible.

**What I wish I'd known sooner (and now tell every student):**

- **Scope it down!** A small *finished* thing beats a fragile “ambitious” demo.
- **Reproducibility over hype:** If it’s a pain to install or run, it never gets used.
- **Explain with context:** Your README should be a tour, not a code dump.

The best conversations I've had started with, "Here's the problem my project solved (and how I made sure it really worked, even on someone else's laptop)."

*Bottom line*: Real projects live and die by whether someone else can use (and trust) them—*not* just if your model had 0.2% higher accuracy.
