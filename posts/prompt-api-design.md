## Relay Hack X Aqore - Hackathon Win

I’m excited to announce that our team secured victory at the **Relay Hack X Aqore Hackathon**, hosted at **Techspire College**. Working alongside my talented teammates **Nischal Panta** and **Safal Lohani**, we took on the **Staffing Software Innovation Challenge**-a domain that’s widely adopted globally but still emerging in Nepal.

### What We Built

Our subsystem focused on **Candidate Screening & Shortlisting**, one of the most critical pain points in the staffing lifecycle.  
We designed a **database-driven solution** that streamlines how candidates are matched with the right opportunities—practical, scalable, and grounded in real-world hiring workflows.

### What We Learned

This hackathon went far beyond just coding:

- Hands-on exposure to **real enterprise staffing workflows**
- Solution design using **MS SQL Server**
- **JSON-based stored procedures** to handle business logic cleanly
- Clear understanding of the **end-to-end staffing lifecycle**-from client acquisition to payroll

The challenge forced us to think like **software engineers solving actual industry problems**, balancing technical decisions with business constraints.

### Acknowledgement

Grateful to **Relay Hack**, **Aqore Nepal**, and **Techspire College** for creating an environment that prioritizes real learning over gimmicks. Looking forward to applying these insights in future projects.
